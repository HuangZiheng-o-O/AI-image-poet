I suddenly realized that this interesting little project lacked a README, so I uploaded slides （PPT.
The project is a small engineering project standing on the shoulders of the giant (CLIP CHATGLM) and is not very difficult.
Also, it is not end-to-end，which means that it is now outmoded（2024，a year later)
